## Welcome
The webscraper should run without error. If it crashes _for any reason other than you forgot to set the directory_, it means that Rotten Tomatoes developers have once again changed the website configuration. If this is the case, __open an issue to notify me__ (instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)).
